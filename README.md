# QR-Code-Generator-Project
This is my project that will generate and save the custom qr code from given input text.
Here, user can input the text in the text box and select the desired size of the QR code
and then click on generate button to see the generated qr code.
If the user wants to save the generated qr code, then they can click on save button.

The project is live at [here](https://customgenerator.blogspot.com/).
